- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation passed after edge case refinement.**

### Summary of Updates

The specification was updated based on user-identified edge cases around dependency transitions:

1. **User Story 2**: Added dual dependency transitional support scenarios and documented alternative approaches (clean break, shim/adapter) for future exploration.

2. **User Story 3**: Clarified that prebuilt providers live in external repositories and will do a major version bump after `cdktn` Release 1 ships.

3. **User Story 4**: Emphasized that local provider generation is the clean migration path with zero `cdktf` dependencies.

4. **Functional Requirements**: Added FR-023 through FR-032 covering:
   - Provider generator clean output (no `cdktf` deps)
   - Dual dependency transitional support
   - Migration tooling (`cdktn migrate` command)

5. **Edge Cases**: Expanded to cover:
   - Dual dependency coexistence concerns (with research items)
   - Provider dependency mixing scenarios
   - Provider generator edge cases
   - Migration tooling edge cases

6. **Success Criteria**: Added SC-007 through SC-009 for:
   - Dual dependency synthesis
   - Clean local provider generation
   - Migration tool functionality

7. **Assumptions**: Added decisions around dual dependency support, provider release strategy, and migration tooling location.

8. **Decisions Log**: Added table documenting key decisions with rationale and alternatives noted.

### Research Items Identified

The following items MUST be investigated in a spike before main implementation (during specledger.plan phase):

- [x] JavaScript ecosystem concerns with `cdktf` + `cdktn` dual dependency coexistence
- [x] Symbol conflict potential between packages
- [x] Bundler behavior with both packages
- [x] JSII cross-language implications

**Spike Outcome**: If fatal issues are discovered, the dual-dependency approach must be reconsidered.

**Note**: These research items were addressed during the planning phase. See `research.md` for detailed findings and decisions.
